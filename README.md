# ediac
The ultimate editing tool. Vim and Emacs users cower in shame when real men use ediac.

Joke editing program, obviously, and a very choleric and opinionated one at that. Edit files by writing binary! Inspired by the gratuitous elitism over text editors on various forums.

## Usage

`ediac <filename> <flags>`

Type `ediac dummy -h` for help because I was too lazy to implement cmd-line argument checking properly.

`-b`: bloat flag
clears the screen after every keypress, getting rid of visual bloat. Although, this also requires a system call, so tell me, which is more bloat?

`-h`: help flag
prints this help message and exits with contempt.

`-t`: text flag
allows less skilled people to type text through binary ASCII instead.

## While editing
`h` for 0, `j` for 1, `k` to exit. Backspaces not supported. Who need backspaces, anyway? *You?*

## Help
From the help text itself:

>Ediac stands for "ed is a crutch", and looks towards the heyday of ENIAC and EDSAC, when men were men and programmers whispered sweet nothings into the proverbial ears of machines before screwing the living daylights out of them on the cold floor of the air-conditioned mainframe room. ediac is obviously catered towards the most elite programmers who write in binary.
